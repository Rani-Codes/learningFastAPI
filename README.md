# Project Stack: Next.js, FastAPI, SQLite

Reading the official FastAPI documentation and messing around with developing a CRUD API using the framework.

After reading the FastAPI docs I have decided to create a simple ToDo app with user auth

Once I was satasfied with how the backend was performing I decided to move on to the Next.js documentation to get a review of react concepts and to also figure out how to use Next.js to connect my frontend to my backend and database.

### Note to Self: Node modules should not be committed to repository. (Add node_modules directory to .gitignore file)

### Note to Self: Future projects deploy the frontend to Vercel and backend to Render if you want free hosting.

### Note to Self: When deploying to Vercel or Render, don't add quotes around the env variable values, it leads to countless CORS errors.

# Update: After nearly three weeks of working on this, and around 80 hours spent, the project is finally done and deployed. I am very happy with how it turned out and am proud of myself for designing, developing, and deploying it all on my own.

## If you would like to try the app out go to: **todo-frontend-zeta-sandy.vercel.app/**
